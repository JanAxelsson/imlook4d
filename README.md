# imlook4d

Introduction
------------

Imlook4d started as a viewer for 4-dimensional viewer for medical PET, CT, MRI images, but has for more than a decade evolved to include tools typically not available.  The most important feature is the easy method to extend functionality by adding a single matlab file into a folder (resulting in it becoming an integrated menu in imlook4d)

Features
--------

The program is developed in Matlab

Some features of imlook4d:
* Full 4D VOI analysis, using brush tool (easier than polygons), thresholded brushing. 
* Load and Save VOI definitions.
* DICOM, Nifti, Analyze, ECAT (very fast compared to Matlabs routines), and reads binary, interfile and some other formats
* Export/Import to Matlab workspace, for full data manipulation for researchers
* Drop-in SCRIPTS (Matlab language) that makes it easy to add matlab code to imlook4d menues
* Some 30 useful scripts for Matrix and ROI manipulations
* Interactive help, click on the GUI or menu, and a detailed help opens
Requirements: Windows, Linux or MacOS, and Matlab with no extra toolboxes
