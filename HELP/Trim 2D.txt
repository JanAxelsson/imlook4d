<h1>Trim 2D</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
	<P>
	This script keeps the rectangle surrounding the ROI.  The remaining pixels outside the ROI-rectangle are discarded.  

	</P>  
	<p>		
		<B>NOTE:</B><BR>
		The "Trim 2D" script keeps all slices, and only truncates in x and y directions.  If the intention is to truncate
also in the z-direction, use "Trim 3D" instead.
