<h1>Profile Slices</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
	<P>
	Displays a profile of a ROI along the slice dimension (z-axis).  The currently selected ROI is used.  Also in dynamic (4D) data, the current frame is used.
	</P>

	<P>
	There are two use cases:
    <ol type="1">
    <li>
        The ROI is defined in one slice only.  Then the activity over the cross section defined in the ROI-slice is calculated for every slice.  
    </li>
    <li>
        The ROI is defined as a volume, with different size in different slices.  In this case  the average activity in each ROI-slice is calculated and graphed <b>only for the slices defined</b> in the ROI.  

    </li>
    </ol>
	</P>
