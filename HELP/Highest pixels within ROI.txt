<h1>Highest pixels within ROI</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
	<P>
	This takes the highest N pixels within the currently selected ROI, and removes all other pixels from this ROI.
	</P>

	<P>
	It uses the currently selected ROI as a search volume.  The selection is performed 
    only within the pixels in the current ROI. Thus, the current ROI will be smaller than the current ROI.

	</P>
    Compare this to "Threshold ROI" which searches for pixels in the whole volume. 

	</P>
 
	<P>
    <B> NOTE:</B> An error will occur if the value of N is higher than the number of pixels in the ROI!
