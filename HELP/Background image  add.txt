
<h1>Background image - add</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
<p> 
This script is used to add a background image to the currently viewed image. It then becomes a fusion image. 
</p>

<p> 
The following applies to this image:
</p>

		<UL>
			<LI> The added image must be exactly the same matrix as the currently viewed image.  (Use the script <code>/SCRIPTS/Matrix/Put in other matrix </code> to achieve this)
			<LI> The background image is entirely living in its original imlook4d window.  It is only displayed as a background in the fusion image.
			<LI> The above implies that:
            <UL>
                <LI>  The original-background imlook4d-window cannot be closed (because then the background image is not existing anymore)
                <LI>  A change in the original-background imlook4d-window is also displayed int the fusion image  
                <LI>  If you wish to change for instance window levels on a background CT, this is done by changing window levels in the original-background imlook4d-window.
            </UL>
		</UL>
