<h1>Interpolate x2</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
	<P>
	When a check-mark is on the "Interpolate" preference, a bi-linear interpolated image with 2-times the number of pixels is shown on screen.
	</P>

	<P>  
	The underlaying image matrix is not changed - this is only a display feature showing an image.
