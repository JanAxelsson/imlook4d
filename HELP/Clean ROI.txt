<h1>Clean ROI</h1>

<!------------------->
	<P>
		Cleans up a ROI with respect to narrow features, and holes.  A typical application is to clean up ROIs such as in the lung-tissue interface in CT
		where medium intensity values that are due to the partial volume effect will be falsely incorporated into a thresholded ROI.
		Running this script, will clean up these ROI pixels.
	</P>
	<P>
		Furthermore, in a second pass, this filter will remove noise speckles within large ROI regions.
 
	</P>	
	<P>
		The filter width is hard coded into the script, in units of pixels. The script uses a flat square kernel with the side being the width in pixels.
		Hence, the filter width can be changed by changing the width value in the script itself.  The filter works in 2D slices, and loops through the full volume.
