<h1>Trim 3D</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
	<P>
	This script keeps a cube of pixels surrounding the 3-dimensional ROI.  The remaining pixels outside the ROI-cube are discarded.

	</P>  
	<p>		
		<B>NOTE:</B><BR>
		If the ROI is within a single slice, the z-direction will be truncated.  If the intention is to truncate only
the x and y directions in the axial slice it is recommended to use Trim 2D instead.
