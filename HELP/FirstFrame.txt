<h1>First frame</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
	<P>
	Sets the first frame to be used in the Principal Component filter.  Frames before this are excluded from the filtering process. 
	</P>
	
	<P>
	For instance in a 32 frame dynamic scan, if first frame is set to 3, frames 1 and 2 are displayed without filtering, and frames 3-32 are filtered using the Hotelling filter.
