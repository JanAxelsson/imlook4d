	Hotelling (PCA) filter.  This filter works by doing the following calculations:
	
		<UL>
			<LI> Calculate the principal components for the <I>current slice</I>, using the Hotelling transform.  
				This requires a dynamic series.
				
			<LI> Set all components not within the range between the low and high PCA sliders to zero.
			<LI> Reverse the Hotelling transform, to get back into the image domain.  
		</UL>  
		Pixels that are zero are not included in the calculations.
	</P>

	<P>
	This slider sets the highest Principal Component to keep.  
	For instance, if component 5 is selected, components 6, 7, ... are set to zero.
	</P>
	
	<P>
	The value below the sliders show the percent of the total variance included by the selected principal components.
	For instance, 100% means that all the variance in the data is perfectly explained.  
	Using this measure is one way to get a feeling for how well the data is explained.
	</P>
	
	<P>
	The second value below the sliders shows the normalized eigen value for the least significant of the selected principal components.
	One suggested way of judging which principal components to discard is the Kaiser criterion.  
	It says that the normalized eigenvalue should be above or around one, for the least significant component.
