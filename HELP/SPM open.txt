        This mode requires SPM packages to be added to the path.

        The SPM package can be found at <a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html </a>

        If files are created with SPM you may be interested in comparing the opening function
        to imlook4d's normal opening functions.  Note that conversions between file formats
        is not supported by imlook4d, so that a file opened by SPM should be saved by SPM.
