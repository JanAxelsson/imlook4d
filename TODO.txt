DEVELOP


[  ]   HELP files for models 

[  ]   Add Models for  clearance

[  ]	Make reference Patlak -- or save ref region to variable

[  ]   Vectorize SRTM, SRTM2 (possible?)

[  ]   Make mask, allowing models on images to work better

[  ]   Script rotate button



WISHLIST
[  ]   Check if toolboxes exists for scripts. For instance Grow_ROI.m needing Imaging Toolbox
			How?  
			- flag-file SCRIPTS/ROI/Grow_ROI.toolbox  ?
			- function hard-coded in imlook4d that checks named files
			
			

[  ]   Make Tissue probability map based ROI when doing "apply atlas" (see script SPM_Segmented_ROIs.m)
       Copy LUT to current folder.  I have a copy in imlook4d LUT folder called TPM something

[  ]   ask if wish to rotate linked images with same size, or background image when toggling rotating button off


[  ]   modelWindow and tactWindow:  make column widths optimal to fit more.
[  ]   modelWindow: show parameters
[  ]   modelWindow: allow update of model


[  ]   Update menu, should it save the new downloaded path by default?  Dialog window asking to save?

[  ]   Tact window add Edit/copy menu



IDEAS
[   ]	Can I make robuster SRTM-like model by fixing BPs calculated from Logan ?


PEARL-PD
[  ]   loop script to get TACTs and calculate parameters



ISSUES
======

[  ]  Error using webread (line 122)
		Could not establish a secure connection to "drive.google.com". The reason is "error:14090086:SSL
		routines:ssl3_get_server_certificate:certificate verify failed". Check your certificate file (C:\Program
		Files\MATLAB\R2018b\sys\certificates\ca\rootcerts.pem) for expired, missing or invalid certificates.
		
		Error in Update_imlook4d (line 7)
		text = webread( latestFileListURL);
		 
		Error while evaluating Menu Callback.
		
		Possible workaround:  
			o = weboptions('CertificateFilename','');
			webread('https://self-signed.badssl.com/',o)



DONE
====
[ok]   rotate lines in current axes, when toggling rotating button off -- solved by turning line off instead

[ok]  Upgrade tar inte bort alla gamla ur path:en.  Även /../USER_SCRIPTS ligger kvar från andra versione
[ok]   Warn if SPM saknas när man väljer meny
[ok]   jpeg dicoms
[ok]   Skript vrida vinkel -- kanske med dialogruta när man vrider ?
[ok]  Patlak -- add with Cp 

[ok]   SPM/select atlas, dialog (done), ask to show folder.

[ok]   measure tool, make handles on line to adjust (unfortunately draws ROI while moving line, if ROI exists)
[ok]  Saved ROI with locks does not display locks when opened.  
[ok]   Cancel on threshold ROI and others crashes lots of things. Clear all resolves
[ok]   interactive min and max level settings. 
[ok]  View / Background image add -- fails on NM-CT.  CT is lost, or takes forever
[ok]   Move new MODELS to MODELS menu
[ok]   Save time-activity to different formats from tactWindow window (especially sif and pmod)
[ok]   Move Time-activity from "Models on ROIs" to TACT button (after above)

[ok]   PROBLEM -- short frames (GE water scans) have T and dT that does not add up.  How to solve?
	   Maybe save Tstart and dT as well as midtimes for models?
[ok]   Cancel on threshold ROI and others crashes lots of things. Clear all resolves
