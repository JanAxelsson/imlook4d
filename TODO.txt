[  ]   Add Model for Retention index
[  ]   Add Models for  clearance

[  ]	Make reference Patlak -- or save ref region to variable

[  ]   Vectorize SRTM, SRTM2 (possible?)

[  ]   Make mask, allowing models on images to work better

[  ]   Script rotate button

[  ]   Trim2D and Trim3D, change location
[  ]   SPM, if DICOM, automatically make DICOM

>>>>>>> Stashed changes


WISHLIST
[  ]   ROI Table with histogram for marked ROI
[  ]   TACT window as Model Window, but with histogram for marked ROI and Frame

[  ]   modelWindow: show parameters
[  ]   modelWindow: allow update of model

[  ]   jpeg dicoms
[  ]   Update menu, should it save the new downloaded path by default?


IDEAS
[   ]	Can I make robuster SRTM-like fixing BPs from Logan ?


PEARL-PD
[  ]   loop script to get TACTs and calculate parameters
