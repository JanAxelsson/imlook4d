DEVELOP
[ok]   Move new MODELS to MODELS menu
[ok]   Save time-activity to different formats from tactWindow window (especially sif and pmod)
[  ]   Move Time-activity from "Models on ROIs" to TACT button (after above)

[ok]   PROBLEM -- short frames (GE water scans) have T and dT that does not add up.  How to solve?
	   Maybe save Tstart and dT as well as midtimes for models?
	   
[  ]   Keep old models.  Idea, keep logan.m etc, and make new files jlogan.m for the new models.	   


[  ]   HELP files for models 

[  ]   Add Models for  clearance
[  ]   Add Patlak for images
[  ]   Vectorize SRTM, SRTM2 (possible?)

[  ]   Make mask, allowing models on images to work better

WISHLIST
[  ]   TACT window as Model Window, but 
ok		- with histogram for marked ROI and Frame
		- must be on one frame (how to select frame in dynamic ?)
ok		- Hide time-activity plot if static scan
ok		- Include SAVE tact to file, as in TACT-button
		- When everything included from old TACT-window, link this to TACT button

[  ]   make column widths optimal to fit more.

[  ]   modelWindow: show parameters
[  ]   modelWindow: allow update of model

[  ]   jpeg dicoms
[  ]   Update menu, should it save the new downloaded path by default?


IDEAS
[   ]	Can I make robuster SRTM-like model by fixing BPs calculated from Logan ?


PEARL-PD
[  ]   loop script to get TACTs and calculate parameters
