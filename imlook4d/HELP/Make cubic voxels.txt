
<h1>Make cubic voxels</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
<p> 
This script converts voxels to cubic voxels. The dimension may be edited by user, where the suggested default is matching the smallest side of original voxels.

<p> 
Note: DICOM cannot be saved if this script changes the number of slices.  If the voxel size matches that in the scanner z-direction,  the number of slices should be fine.
