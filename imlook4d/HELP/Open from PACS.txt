		Loads medical images from PACS.  Currently working on Windows computers

<B>1. PACS opening  - how it works</B>
<!---------------------------------------->
	<P>
		The PACS is queried using dialogs:  
		<UL>
			<LI>  In the first dialog box a <i>patient</i> can be looked up from Patient Name, Patient ID, or Study Date. <BR><BR>
			<LI>  In the second dialog box, a list of studies matching the Patient search is displayed.  One <i>study</i> can be selected.<BR><BR>
			<LI>  In the next dialog box, a list of scans from the selected patient is displayed.  One <i>scan</i> can be selected.<BR><BR>
			<LI>  The selected scan is transferred.  This can be seen in the DICOM receiver window which should have been opened automatically.
			      The selected scan will appear in a new imlook4d window.  Optionally, if by some reason more than one scans have been transmitted
			      a new list will be displayed.<BR><BR>
			<LI>  The DICOM series is not saved, you have to do this manually from the File/Save menu. 
	    </UL>

	</P>

			
<B>2. PACS setup</B>
<!--------------->
	<P>
	DICOM network operations take place between a client and a server (PACS).  
	Both the client and PACS are defined by AE_TITLE, IP-number, and port number.
	The PACS needs to have the client registered; otherwise it does not allow transfers to the client.
	</P><P>	
	
		
		The following is needed to setup imlook4d for DICOM transfers:  
		<OL>
			<LI>  A registration of your PC on the PACS.  <BR><BR>
				The technical personell responsible for the PACS can provide you with registration information. <BR><BR>

			<LI>  The information is entered the first time "File/Open from PACS" is selected.  <BR><BR>
			      The information is edited into a file which is automatically opened in an editor ("DICOM_CLIENT.m").<BR>
			      The important entries that needs to be filled in are: AE_TITLE, IP-number or computer name, and port number. <BR>
				<B>Note: The security settings of your computer may have to be adjusted to allow you to save the file.</B>
				<BR><BR>

				This information is stored locally <BR>
				(typically under "C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\imlook4d" <BR> or 
			 	"C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\imlook4d" ), <BR>
				and can be edited from here, if needed.<BR><BR>

			<LI>  Edit one of the files in "imlook4d\PACS\" for the PACS server's AE_TITLE, IP-number, and port number and save it under a name that describes the PACS server (file name using only characters a-z, A-Z, _, 0-9).<BR>
				<B>Note: The security settings of your computer may have to be adjusted to allow you to save the file.</B>
				<BR><BR>
