<h1> Fill Hole</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
This script fills a region of voxels within a hollow selected ROI, going slice by slice.  

    <P>	


	</P> 
	<P>The input in the dialog is:
	
		<TABLE>


			<tr>
			<td> <b> Output ROI&nbsp;</b></td>
			<td> This field can have the ROI number in the ROI list, "new", or "current" 
                "new" means that the pixels in the hole will be added into a new ROI
                "current" means that the current ROI will grow
            </td>
			</tr>
			
			<tr>
			<td> <b> Filter size (pixels) </b></td>
			<td> A pre-filter to fill smaller gaps and therefore close a wall. If you get slices that are not filled, try increasing this filter size </td>
			</tr>



		</TABLE>
