<h1>SPM select atlas</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
	<P>
		Select the atlas to use. The default atlas, if nothing is selected, is the Neuromorphometrics atlas included in SPM. 
	</P>

	<P>
		Atlases are defined by the .txt file, whereas the ROI file in MNI space is a file in the Matlab path with the same name but extension .nii.
                For instance the AAL2.txt file is coupled to the AAL2.nii ROI-definition file from the AAL atlas (which you have to download yourself).
	</P>

	<P> 
        This script requires SPM packages to be added to the path.
	</P>

	<P> 
        The SPM package can be found at <a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html </a>
