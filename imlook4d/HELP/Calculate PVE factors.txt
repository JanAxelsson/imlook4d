<h1>Calculate PVE factors</h1>

<!------------------->
	<P>
	This routines calculates Partial Volume correction factors from the ROIs, using the Geometric Transfer Matrix, GTM, method.
	</P><P>	
    Partial volume corrected ROI values are calculated on static images with the "TACT" button, and with the script "ROI data to workspace".  
    The corrected data is displayed in a separate column named "pvc-mean", close to the column "mean" which is the non-corrected mean.
	</P><P>	
     The partial volume correction factors are stored in the Matlab Workspace, in the variable "pveFactors".  Partial volume correction is turned off, with the command "clear pveFactors", or "clear all".

	<P>The full width half maximum (FWHM) measure in x, y, z directions are required, and input in a dialog:
