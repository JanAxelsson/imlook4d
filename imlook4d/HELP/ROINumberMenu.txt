<h1>General information about ROIs</h1>
<!------------------->
	<P>
	The term ROI should be understood as a Region Of Interest.  This is sometimes called VOI (Volume Of Interest).  
    In imlook4d, the ROI is defined in 3 dimensions, including pixels from multiple slices.  Therefore talking about a region of interest
    in single slices, and a volume of interest being a composite of these has no meaning.  Instead the word ROI and VOI can be interchanged.
	</P>
    <P>
	ROIs are drawn by a Brush, where the size can be modified by the <code>Brush</code> size input
	</P>
	<P>
	ROIs can be displayed in multiple ways, as defined by the menu <code>Edit/ROI</code>.
	</P>
	<P>
	Each selection from  <code>Edit/ROI</code> menu can be displayed in two ways: as a contour or as a shaded area.  This is selected by the  <code>Contour</code> check-box
	</P>
	<P>
	The ROI overlay can be temporarily hidden from view by the <code>Hide</code> check-box.  Sometimes it is useful to "blink" the ROI by clicking the <code>Hide</code> check-box multiple times.
	</P>
	<P>
	Multiple scripts extend the ROI functionality.  See the <code>SCRIPTS/ROI</code> menu.
