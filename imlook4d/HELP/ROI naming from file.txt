<h1>ROI naming from file</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
	<P>
		Reads a lookup table and converts ROI labels being numbers to their corresponding names.
	</P>


	<P> 
        Lookup tables should be tab-separated with the left column containing numbers, and the second column containing a name corresponding to the numbered ROI.
        The default location for lookup tables is opened by default (imlook4d/ROI_LUTs), but any location can be selected.
	</P>

   

	<P> 
        If you have some common lookup tables, please send them to the author, and they will be incorporated in the next release of imlook4d
