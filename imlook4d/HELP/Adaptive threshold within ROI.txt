<h1>Adaptive Threshold within ROI</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
	<P>
	This creates an adaptively thresholded ROI witin the boundaries of the currently selected ROI.  
	</P>

	<P>
	It uses the currently selected ROI as a search volume.  Adaptive thresholding is calculated globally, but applied 
    only within the pixels in the current ROI. Thus, the new ROI will be smaller than the current ROI.
	</P>


<P>
The inputs in the dialog are:
	
		<TABLE>
			<TR>
			<TD> <B> Sensitivity &nbsp;</B></TD>
			<TD> A value between 0 and 1.  Lower value gives a smaller volume  </TD>
			</TR>
			
			<TR>
			<TD> <B> Background </B></TD>
			<TD> A background level which is subtracted from the pixel values, prior to adaptive thresholding.  This value may be zero if the contrast is high between signal and background </TD>
			</TR>

		</TABLE>
</P>

<P>
The adaptive threshold uses the Bradley method on the global image, which is preprocessed as follows: 
<OL>
<LI> Background level is subracted
<LI> Pixel values are normalized to 1 for highest pixel within ROI
<LI> My modification to this method : set everything outside current ROI to the median value of the ROI, to lessen the impact of high values outside ROI.
</OL>

The method is then applied globally to the preprocessed image, and pixels that satisfied the Bradley sensitivity setting are marked as valid.  Finally,
the ROI is updated so that only pixels within the original ROI are kept.
