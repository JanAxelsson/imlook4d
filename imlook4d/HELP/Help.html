		Imlook4d is a research grade 4-dimensional image browser, with the following capabilities:
	</P><P>
		It is strong in medical imaging where it can be used for static (3D volumes) as well as dynamic/gated (4D volumes).
		What makes imlook4d stand out is its scripting capabilities.  Due to its strong integration with the Matlab environment, 
		it is very easy to integrate menu-driven home-built algorithms, simply by saving a short Matlab m-file in a special folder.

	    This is just a brief description of the capabilities of the base imlook4d.  Lots and lots of extensions are added in the SCRIPTS menu,
	    which is the mechanism to add functionality without having to change the base imlook4d software.
