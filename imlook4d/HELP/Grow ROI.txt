<h1>Grow ROI</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
	<P>
	This grows the currently selected ROI down to a specified threshold value. Growing stops when no further connected voxels are found above the threshold value.
	</P><P>	
This script <B>extends</B> the current ROI volume starting to grow from the highest pixel in the marked ROI until all connected pixels are above threshold.
This process is done in two iterations: 
		<TABLE>

			
			<ul>
			<li> first iteration finds a threshold from the highest pixel in the selected ROI, and the 
			<li> second iteration uses the highest pixel from the first iteration as a seed for one more region growth. 
			</li>
			</ul>
		</TABLE>


In effect, this is the same as a region growth followed by "Threshold within ROI".
This can be compared to "Threshold within ROI" which <B>only decreases</B> the selected ROI until all pixels are above threshold.

	</P> 
	<P>The input in the dialog is:
	
		<TABLE>

			
			<TR>
			<TD> <B> Threshold value</B></TD>
			<TD> This is the threshold defining the edge where the growing of the ROI stops.  Absolute or % of max pixel value in frame.</TD>
			</TR>

		</TABLE>
