<h1>Grow ROI</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
	<P>
	This grows the currently selected ROI. The region growth starts at the highest pixel in the ROI and stops when no further connected voxels are found above the threshold value. 

	</P><P>	


This can be viewed as the opposite to "Threshold within ROI" which <B>only decreases</B> the selected ROI until all pixels are above threshold.

	</P> 
	<P>The input in the dialog is:
	
		<TABLE>

			
			<TR>
			<TD> <B> Threshold value</B></TD>
			<TD> This is the threshold defining the edge where the growing of the ROI stops.  Absolute or % of max pixel value in frame.</TD>
			</TR>

		</TABLE>
