<!------------------->
	<P>
	This grows the currently selected ROI until it is filling the volume down to a threshold value. 
	</P><P>	
This script <B>extends</B> the current ROI volume starting to grow from the highest pixel in the marked ROI until all connected pixels are above threshold.
.
This can be compared to "Threshold within ROI" which <B>decreases</B> the selected ROI until all pixels are above threshold.

		<TABLE>

			
			<TR>
			<TD> <B> Threshold value</B></TD>
			<TD> This is the threshold defining the edge where the growing of the ROI stops.  Absolute or % of max pixel value in frame.</TD>
