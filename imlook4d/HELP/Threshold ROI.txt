<h1>Threshold ROI</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
	<P>
	This creates a ROI defined to the currently selected ROI name.  The threshold condition is used to search the 
whole volume.  
	</P><P>	
Compare this to "Threshold within ROI" which searches for pixels in the whole volume (both inside and outside the ROI). 

	</P> 
	<P>The inputs in the dialog are:
	
		<TABLE>
			<TR>
			<TD> <B> Max pixel value &nbsp;</B></TD>
			<TD> Either an absolute pixel value, or a value in % of max pixel value in current frame. </TD>
			</TR>
			
			<TR>
			<TD> <B> Min pixel value</B></TD>
			<TD> This is the last slice the ROI will be copied into.  Absolute or % of max pixel value in frame.</TD>
			</TR>
			
			<TR>
			<TD> <B> First slice</B></TD>
			<TD> The first slice to threshold within.</TD>
			</TR>
			
			<TR>
			<TD> <B> Last slice</B></TD>
			<TD> The last slice to threshold with.  Thus the thresholding will only occur between [First slice] and [Last slice].</TD>
			</TR>
		</TABLE>

	</P>  <!-- This text is the same for Threshold_ROI.txt and Threshold_within_ROI.txt-->
	<p>
		The first and last slice can be specified either as an absolute slice number, or as a slice number relative to the current displayed slice.  
		A relative slice number starts with one of the signs + or -.  
	</P>
	<p>		
		<B>An example:</B><BR>
		Assume that the current displayed slice=120.  
		Then, setting "First slice"=-10 and 
		"Last slice"=+9  means that the threshold operation will be performed between slices 110 to 130 (120-10 to 120+9).
