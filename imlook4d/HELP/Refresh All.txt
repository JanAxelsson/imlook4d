
<h1>Refresh All Script</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
<P>
	This script refreshes all open imlook4d windows.  This can be useful if the imlook4d version has changed because imlook4d was upgrade in the current matlab session.
</P><P>
Another reason can be that figure files saved with an older version (see "Save Windows + Layout (all windows)" ) were opened with a later imlook4d version.
