<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
<p> 
This script is used to fit an image volume into the space of another which is in the same coordinate system, but with different slices, matrices and field-of-view.  
A typical use case is to format two images from a hybrid imaging system (PET/CT, PET/MR, ...) into the same matrix.
If the images are in the same matrix, it allows us to draw ROIs one image, save the ROIs, and load the into the other image.

<p> 
The following applies to this image:
</p>

		<UL>
			<LI> DICOM images have space information, which allows imlook4d to reformat hybrid imaging (PET/CT, PET/MR, ..) which are acquired in a common space to exactly fit the same image matrix.
            <LI> To display a background image this image must be exactly the same matrix as the currently viewed image.  
			<LI> <B> NOTE:</B>The modified current image now had different matrix to the original image.  It is therefore advisable to save this image
