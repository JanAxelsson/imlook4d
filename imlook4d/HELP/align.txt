		Aligns a dynamic scan to minimize motion artifacts

	<P> 
        This mode requires SPM packages to be added to the path.
	</P>

	<P> 
        The SPM package can be found at <a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html </a>

	<P> 
        The alignment reads a 4D nifti file and uses the spm spatial realignment functions optimized for PET. 
	</P>

	<P> 
        For PET, often the first frames are meaningless being only noise.  This may cause the realignment to fail.  Therefore, you will in a dialog need to
        define the first frame to use for realignment.
