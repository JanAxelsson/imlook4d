<h1>Threshold ROI</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
	<P>
	This creates a ROI defined to the currently selected ROI name.  The threshold condition is used to search the 
whole volume.  
	</P><P>	
Compare this to "Threshold within ROI" which searches for pixels in the whole volume (both inside and outside the ROI). 
Threshold level can be determined two ways, either as an absolute level, or as a relative level specified as %.
 
</P><P>	
If the background = 0, and threshold value is in percent, then the threshold level = 0.01 * threshold * maxValue.
</P><P>	
If the background different from 0, and threshold value is in percent, then the 
<pre>threshold level = 0.01 * (threshold - background) * maxValue + background.

	</P> 
	<P>The inputs in the dialog are:
	
		<TABLE>
			<TR>
			<TD> <B> Max pixel value &nbsp;</B></TD>
			<TD> Either an absolute pixel value, or a value in % of max pixel value in current frame. </TD>
			</TR>
			
			<TR>
			<TD> <B> Min pixel value</B></TD>
			<TD> This is the last slice the ROI will be copied into.  Absolute or % of max pixel value in frame.</TD>
			</TR>
			
			<TR>
			<TD> <B> First slice</B></TD>
			<TD> The first slice to threshold within.</TD>
			</TR>
			
			<TR>
			<TD> <B> Last slice</B></TD>
			<TD> The last slice to threshold with.  Thus the thresholding will only occur between [First slice] and [Last slice].</TD>
			</TR>
			
			<TR>
			<TD> <B> Background</B></TD>
			<TD> The background value</TD>
			</TR>
		</TABLE>

	</P>  <!-- This text is the same for Threshold_ROI.txt and Threshold_within_ROI.txt-->
	<p>
		The first and last slice can be specified either as an absolute slice number, or as a slice number relative to the current displayed slice.  
		A relative slice number starts with one of the signs + or -.  
	</P>
	<p>		
		<B>An example:</B><BR>
		Assume that the current displayed slice=120.  
		Then, setting "First slice"=-10 and 
		"Last slice"=+9  means that the threshold operation will be performed between slices 110 to 130 (120-10 to 120+9).
