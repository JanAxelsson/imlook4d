        Note that conversions between file formats is not supported by imlook4d.  Similarely, it is not advised to open and
        save using different routines.  That is, opening with imlook4d's routine, you should also save a modified image by imlook4d's routine.
        If you are opening an image with the SPM script, you should also save using the SPM script.
