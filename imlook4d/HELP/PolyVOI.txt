<h1>Define a ROI using a Polygon</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
	<P>
	If "Add Polygon ROI" is pressed, a new ROI contour can be defined in the currently selectedROI. 
    This is done by drawing a polygon. The polygon is not a ROI, but is a tool to create a ROI.
    This polygon can be converted to a normal ROI (which is defined for individual pixels in the image the polygon ROI).
	</P>


	<P>
	The following steps are involved when using the polygon tool to make a ROI:
       
		<OL>

			<LI> If no ROI is defined, start with selecting "Add ROI" from the ROI dropdown menu.  Otherwise, select the ROI you wish work in.
			<LI> Select the "Add Polygon ROI" button
            
			<LI> Make new nodes (corners) of the polygon by clicking in the image


			<LI>  Close the polygon by either 1) clicking on the first node, or 2) right-click
			<LI>  You may draw additional polygons, in this or other slices

			<LI>  The final step is to convert the polygon to a ROI. This is done by right-clicking one of the following:
            <UL>
                <LI>  <B>To ROI </B> which converts the polygon you clicked to a ROI
                <LI>  <B>All to ROIs</B> which converts all polygons to a ROI
            </UL>

		</OL>
 
	</P>
	
	<P>
	<B>NOTE:</B> On some computers, the right-click works only when simultaneously pressing [Ctrl] key on keyboard
