<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
<p> 
This script is used to add a background image in same space to the currently viewed image. It then becomes a fusion image. 
The background image can be removed by the script <CODE>Background image - remove</CODE>
</p>

<p> 
The following applies to this image:
</p>

		<UL>
			<LI> DICOM images have space information, which allows imlook4d to reformat hybrid imaging (PET/CT, PET/MR, ..) which are acquired in a common space to exactly fit the same image matrix.
            <LI> To display a background image this image must be exactly the same matrix as the currently viewed image.  
                 This is thus achieved automatically for DICOM images.  
                 In reality, the pixel matrix of the current image is modified to match the matrix of the selected background image.
            <LI> It is worth noting, that the image may become big. 
			<LI> Alternatively, if you wish to have more control, and for instance instead keep the number of pixels in the current image,
                do the following:
                 <OL> 
                    <LI> Modify the matrix of the image you want in the background by running the script <code>/SCRIPTS/Matrix/Put in other matrix </code> on that image.
                    <LI> Following this change, you can select this script <code>/SCRIPTS/View/Background image add </code> from the foreground image
                </OL>
			<LI> The background image is entirely living in its original imlook4d window.  It is only displayed as a background in the fusion image.
			<LI> The above implies that:
            <UL>
                <LI>  The original-background imlook4d-window cannot be closed (because then the background image is not existing anymore)
                <LI>  A change in the original-background imlook4d-window is also displayed in the fusion image  
                <LI>  If you wish to change for instance window levels on a background CT, this is done by changing window levels in the original-background imlook4d-window.
                <LI>  <B> NOTE:</B>The modified current image now had different matrix to the original image.  It is therefore advisable to save this image
            </UL>
