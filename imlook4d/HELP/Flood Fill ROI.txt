<h1>Flood Fill ROI</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
	<P>
	This grows the currently selected ROI using the Flood Fill algorithm in 3D. The region growth starts at the highest pixel in the selected ROI and stops when no further connected voxels are found above the threshold value. 

	</P><P>	


This can be viewed as the opposite to "Threshold within ROI" which <B>only decreases</B> the selected ROI until all pixels are above threshold.

	</P> 
	<P>The input in the dialog is:
	
		<TABLE>

			
			<TR>
			<TD> <B> Threshold value</B></TD>
			<TD> This is the threshold defining the edge where the growing of the ROI stops.  Absolute or % of max pixel value in frame.</TD>
			</TR>

		</TABLE>

	</P> 
	<P>
	If preceeding the absolute value with "<" the Flood Fill finds pixels below the given ROI level. For instance "<10" draws only in pixels below value 10.  
    <BR>NOTE: this does not work with "%" notation
