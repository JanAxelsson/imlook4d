<h1>Flood Fill ROI</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
	<P>
	This grows the currently selected ROI using the Flood Fill algorithm in 3D. The region growth starts at the highest pixel in the selected ROI and stops when no further connected voxels are found above the threshold value. 

	</P><P>	


This can be viewed as the opposite to "Threshold within ROI" which <B>only decreases</B> the selected ROI until all pixels are above threshold.

	</P> 
	<P>The input in the dialog is:
	
		<TABLE>

			
			<TR>
			<TD> <B> Threshold value</B></TD>
			<TD> This is the threshold defining the edge where the growing of the ROI stops.  Absolute or % of max pixel value in frame.</TD>
			</TR>
