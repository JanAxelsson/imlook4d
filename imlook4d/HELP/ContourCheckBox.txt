<h1>Contor ROI</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
	<P>
	If checked, the ROIs are drawn as contours <u>outside<u> the pixels representing the ROI.
	</P>
	<P>
	If not checked, the ROIs are drawn as shaded areas <u>exactly<u> representing the the pixels of the ROI.
	</P>

	
	<P>
		NOTE: A nicer contour will be drawn if Matlab Imaging Toolbox is present. The contour will be drawn just outside the ROI pixels, meaning that a ROI will visually look slightly larger in volume. Calculations on ROI statistics are not affected.
