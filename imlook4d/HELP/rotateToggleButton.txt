<h1>Rotate Tool </h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
	<P>
		This tools starts an interactive rotation in the plane.  It is activated by pressing the rotate button.  You need to apply the rotation for the image rotation to be implemented.
	</P>

	<P>
		Right-click on the image gives an option to reset the view, or delete the line.  Do this if you wish to keep the image as it was.
	</P>
	<P>
		The rotation is applied to the image first when the button is toggled off.  This cannot be un-done.
	</P>
	
	<P>
		NOTE: each applied rotation will degrade the image.  It is therefore advisable to perform maximum one rotation in each Axial, Coronal and Sagital plane.

		NOTE: Requires Matlab Imaging Toolbox
