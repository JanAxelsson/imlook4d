<H1>Image view port </H1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->

<P>
This is the view port for display of a single 2-dimensional image, at a given location and time.  
</P>

<P>
Data consists of pixels, with a given position in x,y,z, and optionally frame dimension.  The frame can refer to time (dynamic PET, CT) or some sort of phase (dynamic MR, gated PET or CT). 
A slice of this data, at a given z, and frame is drawn in the view port.
</P>

<P>
When a ROI has been created (See Add ROI drop-down list), a region-of-interest (ROI) can be drawn by moving the cursor with pressed left button.
Pressing SHIFT while left-click and moving the mouse makes the cursor act as an eraser instead.
