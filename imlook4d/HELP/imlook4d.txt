<H1>Image view port </H1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->

<P>
This is the view port for display of a single 2-dimensional image, at a given location and time.  
</P>

<P>
Data consists of pixels, with a given position in x,y,z, and optionally frame dimension.  The frame can refer to time (dynamic PET, CT) or some sort of phase (dynamic MR, gated PET or CT). 
A slice of this data, at a given z, and frame is drawn in the view port.
</P>

<P>
When a ROI has been created (See Add ROI drop-down list), a region-of-interest (ROI) can be drawn by moving the cursor with pressed left button.
Pressing SHIFT while left-click and moving the mouse makes the cursor act as an eraser instead.
</P>

<P>
	Right-click shows a contextual menu with the following options:
       
		<UL>

			<LI> Drawing:


			<LI> <B>Clear ROI </B>, clears the current ROI.
			<LI> <B>Set ROI Level</B>, sets the ROI-drawing level (the ROI is drawn only on pixels above this value).
			<LI> <B>Reset ROI Level</B>, sets the ROI-drawing level below the lowest pixel value in the whole file.  This makes the brush draw ROIs without taking the image pixel-intensity value into consideration. 
			<LI> <B>Copy ROI</B>, copies the current ROI into multiple slices.  See <code>SCRIPTS/ROI/Copy ROI</code>			

			<LI> Processing:

            <LI> <B>Threshold within ROI </B>, threshold pixels, searching within the boundaries of the current ROI. See <code>SCRIPTS/ROI/Threshold within ROI</code>	
			<LI> <B>Threshold ROI</B>, threshold pixels in the whole volume. See <code>SCRIPTS/ROI/Threshold ROI</code>	

			<LI> <B>Clean ROI</B>, cleans rough edges from current ROI.  See <code>SCRIPTS/ROI/Clean ROI</code>	
			<LI> <B>Fill ROI Slice Gaps</B>, fill in ROI in empty slices.  This way you don't have to draw in every single slice, but can fill in an extrapolated volume in empty slices.  See <code>SCRIPTS/ROI/Fill ROI Slice Gaps</code>	

			<LI> <B>Close this menu</B>, closes the contextual menu

		</UL>
