<h1>Scree Plot</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
	<P>
	In PCA a "Scree plot" can be used to determined the importance of the different principal components.  The Scree plot shows the eigenvalues on the Y-axis
        and the corresponding principal-component on the X-axis for the dynamic series in the currently selected slice.

	<P>
	Tho calculate the Scree Plot, the "PC Image" radiobutton will be briefly selected automatically.  Since principal component analysis
        requires a 4th dimension, this can only be used four dynamic images
