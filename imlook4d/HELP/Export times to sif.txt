<h1>Export times to sif</h1>

<!------------------->

	<P>
	Nifti files do not carry information about time, which is necessary in some processing of dynamic scans.
    This script exports time information from a DICOM file to a .sif file.

	<P>
	Nifti files can obtain time information by importing it from a .sif file. See "Import times from sif"
