
<h1>Resize 2D matrix</h1>
<HR></HR>
<!------------------->
<p> 
This script is used to resize an image slice by slice into a new matrix size.  
</p>


<p> 
Note: DICOM cannot be saved if Resize 2D is performed in Sagital or Coronal plane, when the number of slices is changed.  Changing the radial direction should work fine.
