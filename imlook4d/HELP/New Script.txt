	<P>
	This menu creates a new empty scripts and sets the path to the correct folder <code>USER_SCRIPTS</code> besides the <code>imlook4d</code>.
If this folder does not exist, it is created.  When you have edited the script it should be saved in this folder, or within a folder that you create here.  Only one extra folder level is allowed.

	<B>Note:</B>
Matlab scripts have the extension ".m".  Scripts can only have the characters alllowed in MATLAB scripts.  According to MATLAB the rules are: <BR>
 M-file names must start with an alphabetic character, may contain any alphanumeric characters or underscores, and must be no longer than the maximum allowed M-file name length 
This means that spaces are not allowed.	If you wish a space-character to appear in the <code>SCRIPTS/USER</code> menu, write an "_" in the file name where you wish a space to appear.

<code>test_script.m</code> is shown as <code>SCRIPTS/USER/test script</code> in the menu
