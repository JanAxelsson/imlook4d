The folder ”USER_SCRIPTS” contains user’s own imlook4d scripts.

This folder should be placed parallel to the imlook4d folder. For instance:
C:\Users\Jan|
            |-imlook4d
            |-USER_SCRIPTS

The USER_SCRIPTS folder does not have to be within the Matlab Path, so it is enough to add  (with subfolders) the imlook4d folder path to the Matlab Path. 


Keeping your own scripts in USER_SCRIPTS allows you to update imlook4d, without having to keep track of the scripts you have created yourself.  Thus this is the recommended procedure.

The ”README.txt” (this file) and ”Scripting-imlook4d.pdf” (manual for scripting) are updated to the latest version when imlook4d is started.
